Meningioma tumors are typically slow-growing tumors that arise from the meninges, the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. They are usually benign, but in rare cases, they can become malignant. Meningiomas can cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, changes in vision, and weakness in the limbs.

Reasons:
- Meningioma tumors develop from abnormal growth of cells in the meninges.
- Hormonal factors, such as estrogen, may play a role in the development of meningioma tumors.
- Previous head trauma or exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing meningioma tumors.

Possible Solution:
- Treatment options for meningioma tumors may include surgery, radiation therapy, and in some cases, chemotherapy or targeted therapy.
- The choice of treatment depends on factors such as the tumor size, location, and overall health of the patient.
- Regular monitoring through imaging studies is important to detect any changes in the tumor and to guide treatment decisions.
