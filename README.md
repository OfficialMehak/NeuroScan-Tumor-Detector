# NeuroScan-Tumor-Detector
 NeuroScan Tumor Detector is an advanced deep learning project aimed at accurately classifying brain tumor types from MRI images. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, the NeuroScan Tumor Detector utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze MRI scans and identify various types of brain tumors with high precision.

# Key Features
Accurate Tumor Classification: The NeuroScan Tumor Detector employs a trained model to classify brain tumors into different types, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary adenoma, and non-tumor cases, enabling early diagnosis and treatment planning.
User-Friendly Web Application: The project includes a user-friendly web application built with Flask, allowing users to upload MRI images and receive real-time predictions about the presence and type of brain tumor.
Explanatory Insights: Upon prediction, users are provided with detailed explanations about the identified tumor type, including possible causes, symptoms, and treatment options, enhancing understanding and facilitating informed decision-making.
